# scoring_algo
using variables as tuples and hiscore 

this will make sense to no one but a one off use case. it's pretty cool you can toss in variables.

hiscore is really cool. the biggest thing is if you dont like the reference set or the scores being tossed out, then recrease the reference set. i have minval = 60 set in the script, so if you run it as it you will never get a score lower than 60.

this is based on a hypothetical for an insurance agency. none of the values in the script mean anything under than showing a scoring function where the heavy lifting is being done by the library.

to run (python 2) 

python agent_score.py 

it will prompt you questions in the terminal and you can answer them. at the end it will print out a statement for joe's score.
